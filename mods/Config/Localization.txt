DFAnimals,Animal husbandry is the art of caring for, and breeding animals. Since you have just found a baby animal, there are some basics that you need to know in order to become successful in breeding your own farm animals. First thing to note is that all animals need beds, food and water in order to survive. Haybales are good beds and water can be provided by simply digging a hole and filling it up with water. However, animals do consume water. Each type of animal also has a different type of food they eat, and it must be in the 'Animal Food Storage' box for them to find it. The food list is as follows. Boar: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob. Goat: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Sheep: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Cow: Plant Fibers, Corn, Corn on the Cob, Yucca. Chicken: Corn, Corn Meal. Wolf: Raw Meat, Rotten Flesh. The 'Animal Water Storage' box is used if you wish to have animals drink jars of water instead of just having a hole in the ground. Chickens also need a chicken nest in order to lay eggs for you. Other animals are primarily just a source of food, but wolves can be convinced to follow you and act as guards with a piece of raw meat. 和訳準備中:DFAnimals
